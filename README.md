# Lonix

Welcome to **Lonix**—a reimagining of Fortnite cheats in a market filled with overpriced options. Cheating should be accessible to everyone who wants to enjoy the fun it brings!  

I’ve spent weeks coding, refining, and perfecting this project. Lonix is a labor of love, and I continue to work on making it even better. I hope you enjoy using Lonix as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it.  

### Current Version
Lonix is currently in **version 1** of its development.  

### Important Note
**NO**, I will NOT release a decrypted version of Lonix for free. Allowing this would open the door for others to steal and resell my work, which is exactly what I stand against. I’ve dedicated countless hours to creating this free project, and I don’t want anyone repurposing my code for profit.  

### Need Additional Features?
If you’d like extra features added to your version, I’ll do my best to help. Join my Discord server here:
